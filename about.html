                        I focus on building websites that are reliable, easy to manage, and designed to grow with your business. When you 
                        work with me, you’re not dealing with a large agency or an anonymous freelancer, you’re working directly with the
                        developer building your site. I keep communication clear, timelines realistic, and I’m always available to answer 
                        questions without technical jargon. My goal isn’t just to launch a website, it’s to create something that continues
                        to work for you long after it goes live.

                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was first introduced to coding during my freshman year of high school in an 
                        Intro to Programming course at Sidney High School. Starting with Python, I quickly 
                        became fascinated by how software could solve real problems and create useful 
                        tools from scratch. Over the next several years, I expanded into additional languages 
                        including C++, Java, and C#, building a strong technical foundation under the guidance 
                        of my instructor, Joe Spangler.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my junior year, I joined the Web Application Team through
                        BPA (Business Professionals of America), where I began focusing on website development 
                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I started as a beginner learning largely 
                        on my own, I quickly developed a deep interest in creating functional, visually 
                        appealing websites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our team placed 10th in the nation, earning a trip to the BPA National Leadership 
                        Conference in Chicago. The following year, we competed again and placed in the top 
                        20 nationally, just short of advancing to the conference. These experiences pushed 
                        me to take my skills further, dedicating much of my free time to learning how to 
                        design and build more professional, efficient, and reliable websites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, that same curiosity and drive continue to guide my work as I help small 
                        businesses establish a strong presence online.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After beginning my studies at Wright State University in Computer Engineering 
                        and Business, I started combining technical expertise with entrepreneurial 
                        thinking — ultimately leading to the creation of Macias Web Forge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have always been drawn to creating things and understanding how
                        they work, especially when it comes to technology and its rapid 
                        evolution. My experience in BPA strengthened my interest in web 
                        development, showing me how lines of code could come together to 
                        form intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My interest in business developed much earlier. Growing up, 
                        I was fascinated by the professionalism, leadership, and 
                        vision associated with building organizations — the idea 
                        of creating something meaningful, leading others, and 
                        presenting oneself with purpose. That fascination never faded.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By combining my passion for technology with an equally strong 
                        interest in business, I founded Macias Web Forge to design modern, 
                        effective websites that help organizations communicate clearly, 
                        operate efficiently, and compete in an increasingly digital world.
