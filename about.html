                        I focus on building websites that are reliable, easy to manage, and designed to grow with your business. When you 
                        work with me, you’re not dealing with a large agency or an anonymous freelancer, you’re working directly with the
                        developer building your site. I keep communication clear, timelines realistic, and I’m always available to answer 
                        questions without technical jargon. My goal isn’t just to launch a website, it’s to create something that continues
                        to work for you long after it goes live.

                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was first introduced to coding during my freshman year of high school in an 
                        Intro to Programming course at Sidney High School. Starting with Python, I quickly 
                        became fascinated by how software could solve real problems and create useful 
                        tools from scratch. Over the next several years, I expanded into additional languages 
                        including C++, Java, and C#, building a strong technical foundation under the guidance 
                        of my instructor, Joe Spangler.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my junior year, I joined the Web Application Team through
                        BPA (Business Professionals of America), where I began focusing on website development 
                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I started as a beginner learning largely 
                        on my own, I quickly developed a deep interest in creating functional, visually 
                        appealing websites.

                    <h2>My Plans for Macias Web Forge</h2>
                    <p>
                        Macias Web Forge was created with a long-term vision, but also with a clear understanding that 
                        meaningful progress takes time. In the near term, my focus is on education, hands-on experience, 
                        and steady improvement. As I continue studying Computer Engineering and Business, I am developing 
                        both the technical skills and practical knowledge needed to build websites that are not only 
                        functional, but reliable and professionally structured. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At this stage, my priority is helping small businesses and organizations establish a strong online 
                        presence through well-built, maintainable websites. With each project, I aim to improve my process, 
                        learn from real-world challenges, and deliver work that provides lasting value rather than quick 
                        results. As my skills grow, I plan to incorporate more advanced features such as stronger performance 
                        optimization, improved accessibility, enhanced security practices, and scalable designs that can 
                        support long-term growth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over time, I hope to expand Macias Web Forge beyond basic website development into broader technology 
                        services. This may include ongoing site management, technical support, consulting, and other digital
